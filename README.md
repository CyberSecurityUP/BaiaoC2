# BaiaoC2

**BaiaoC2** is a Command & Control (C2) platform under development, designed for advanced and customizable operations. This repository is in the initial development phase, and we are currently implementing the GUI using the Fyne framework to make the C2 more intuitive and efficient.

  - **Windows**
  - **Linux**
  - **MacOS**
  - (Mobile platforms are being considered for future updates).

### **Teamserver**
